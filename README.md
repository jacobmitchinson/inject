### Introduction 

The task was to rewrite the ruby inject method. 

### Process

1. Break down what the inject method does, writing on paper 
2. Using TDD, Satisfy the first requirement: given a block, it must be able to add numbers together
3. Satisfy the second requirement: given a block, it must be able to minus two numbers
4. Satisy the third requirement: given a block, it must able to multiply two numbers
5. Same as 2-4 except inject should take an argument
6. Same 2-4 except inject should use a symbol
7. Same as 6 expect should also take an argument

### Status

Complete.

### What I learnt

I originally completed this using around 50 lines. I was able to refactor this down to 11. I learnt a lot about using concise code and approaching problems from different angles to achieve a better answer.
